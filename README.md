# Mock-test-2-java-PPT-PW-skills-Second-Question

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Java project!

## Overview
This project contains three classes that demonstrate how to calculate the area of different shapes. The `Shape` class is an abstract class that defines a method for calculating the area of a shape. The `Rectangle`, `Circle`, and `Triangle` classes are concrete classes that extend the `Shape` class and implement the `calculateArea()` method.

The `ShapeCalculator` class is a utility class that provides a method for printing the area of a shape.

## Usage
To use this project, simply clone the repository and run the `Main` class.

## Example Output
- The area is 50.0
- The area is 153.93804002589985
- The area is 12.0
